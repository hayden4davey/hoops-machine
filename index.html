			<hr>
			<p class="card-text"> 
        This dataset was retrieved from a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats">user</a> on Kaggle.com.  
        The user scraped data from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/">Basketball Reference</a> and compiled it into CSV files.  
        The sataset compiles 67 seasons of NBA player statistics in over 50 different stats, from basic box score figures (points, assists, etc.) to advanced stats (player effiency rating, value over replacement, etc.).  
        <br><br>
        The data cleaning process, which utilized the Pandas library for Python, revealed a high number of void cells, though no duplicates.  
        First, I dropped any columns that were not necessary for this application and also renamed certain columns for consistency.
        I also dropped a handful of less signficant statistical categories to keep the dataset a little more manageable.  
        I also restricted the dataset to begin in 1979 (introduction of the three-point line) as there are significantly more consistent records in the modern era, as well as more statistical categories.
        These restrictions significantly lowered the number of void cells, the remaining of which were replaced with zeroes.  
        The dataset gave season totals for a number of stats, which I converted to per-game stats.  
        I dropped back up positions listed in order to limit the positions to the original five starting position for basketball:
        <ol>
          <li>Point Guard</li>
          <li>Shooting Guard</li>
          <li>Small Forward</li>
          <li>Power Forward</li>
          <li>Center</li>
        </ol>
        Finally, I merged the statistical data with some player info for context, yielding a dataset of 43 columns and over 19 thousand rows.  
        Here are the categories analyzed:
        </p>

			<hr>
			<p class="card-text">I used scikit-learn to set up my initial machine learning models using a linear SVC model.  
        Unneeded non-numerical columns were dropped while the column for player position was label encoded 1-5.  
        The SVC model was run through a grid, yielding the following results.

      <p class="card-text">Point guards were the most accurately predicted position at 86% with centers trailing with 77%.
        One reason the algorithm was most successful with point guards (position 1) may their role in facilitating plays as evidenced by their typically high nuber of assists per game and assist rate.

      <p class="card-text">I took some suggestions to apply standard scaling to the data since as shooting percentage of 0.5 would be weighted much less heavily than a total points per game of 25.
        I also converted the years to weight more recent stats more heavily since the game has evolved.  Games in 1979 were given a value of 1 and each subsequent year an increasing value by 1.
        All of these changes had a small amount of effect, but not substantial. 
        The height and weight stats were converted to body mass index, which did have a substantial effect, as evidenced below.

      <p class="card-text">Test precision for all positions dropped off, with the total accuracy dropping from 71% to 66%, by converting height and weight to BMI.
        The reason for this seems to be that BMI is not strongly correlated with any position in particular, but height mcuh more so is.

      I produced a final linear SVC model, including the above more successful alterations, but with player positions more generalized.
      While the higher success rate with this model can obviously be attributed to there being fewer targets, it may also shed some light on the modern notion that there two or three basic types of players/positions and the traditional five positions of basketball are not accurately represented in the current NBA.
      This model was able to judge whether a player was a guard with 90% accuracy while still struggling with the mid-size, versatile players.
