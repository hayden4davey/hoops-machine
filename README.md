# hoops-machine

This was my first foray into machine learning in Python and my independent final project for the University of Toronto's Data Analysis Bootcamp.  The project is a deep-dive into machine learning, which focused primarily on predicting basketball player's position.  In the project's short timeline, I tried to utilize an array of methods from classification to clustering in Scikit-Learn, as well as neural networks in TensorFlow.  In addition to the notebooks for the various models included in this repository, there is also some basic HTML that served as an analysis and an online jumping point for the presentation to my now-remote classmates.
