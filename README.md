My independent final project for the University of Toronto's Data Analysis Bootcamp is a deep-dive into machine learning, which focused primarily on predicting basketball player's position.  I utilize an array of methods from classification to clustering in Scikit-Learn, as well as neural networks in TensorFlow.  In addition to the notebooks for the various models included in this repository, there is also some basic HTML that served as an analysis and an online jumping off point for the presentation to my classmates.

[Here](https://hayden4davey.github.io/hoops) is the online report for this project.
